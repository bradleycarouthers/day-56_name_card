# day-56_name_card
Day 56 of 100

Rendering HTML/Static files and Using Web Templates. Learning this stuff allowed me to make a "name card", with 3 workable buttons on the bottom. It is very important to note file and directory hierarchy levels! The template I used came with this harsh gradient and it was reformatting the background. I removed them by playing around in the .css file and seeing which edit changes what.
